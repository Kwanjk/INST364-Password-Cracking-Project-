# 🔐 Password‑Security Simulator (2025 Final Prototype)

Interactive Streamlit app that lets non‑expert employees **see** why weak or reused passwords crumble under real‑world attacks—and how small habit changes slash risk.

- **Bounded Rationality:** sliders/presets respect limited attention; visuals remove math barriers.  
- **Mental‑Model Nudges:** each output ends with a myth‑buster that corrects common misconceptions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Most password‑compromise incidents don’t result from exotic zero‑day exploits; they arise from **predictable human behavior**—reusing passwords or assuming small tweaks (“Password1 → Password2”) suffice.  
This simulator shows how these habits are exploited through:

| Technique | What Attackers Do |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Brute‑force** | Systematically try every combination. |
| **Dictionary** | Test high‑probability words/phrases from leaked lists (e.g., *rockyou*). |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Replay usernames + passwords from past breaches on new sites. |

The tool delivers **immediate, visual feedback** that corrects misconceptions while respecting users’ limited time, attention, and cognitive bandwidth.

## 🧠 Human‑Centered Design Philosophy

### 1. Mental Models
Users rely on simplistic metaphors:
* “Long = strong.”  
* “I’ve never been hacked, so I’m safe.”  
* “Adding ‘123!’ makes it secure.”  

We surface *why* these models fail (blast‑radius math, live crack times).

### 2. Bounded Rationality
Memory limits → reuse; perceived hassle → skip managers.  
The UI employs low‑friction sliders, one‑click buttons, and color‑coded feedback to fit real cognitive constraints.

## 🧪 Core Features

| # | Tab | Key Insight |
|---|-----|-------------|
| **1** | **Password Strength Tester** | Shows entropy, dictionary hit, and crack times (GPU vs. web). |
| **2** | **Reuse Blast Radius** | One leak → many accounts. Formula: `math.ceil(n * (1 - (1 - p)**n))`. |
| **3** | **Credential‑Stuffing Wave** | Overlap math reveals org‑wide fallout from reuse × breaches. |
| **4** | **Best‑Practice Coach** | One‑click random password + links to Bitwarden / KeePassXC; MFA tips. |

## 👥 Anticipated User Journey

1. **Hook** – Test a familiar password → instant fail.  
2. **Explore** – Drag sliders, watch risk bars spike.  
3. **Reflect** – Myth‑buster captions correct mental models.  
4. **Act** – Generate strong password, install manager.  
5. **Share** – Screenshots circulate in team chat → viral learning.

## 📊 Why It Matters for Small‑Mid Orgs
* Few dedicate full‑time security staff.  
* Annual training quickly fades.  
* Simulator supplies *experiential* reinforcement with zero admin overhead.

## 🛠️ How the Code Works & Why It Matters

Block | What It Does | Learning Payoff
load_common() | Loads top‑N leaked passwords; caches result. | Enables Dictionary Hit? metric—people grasp “my password is on a public list.”
Entropy/Brute Math brute_seconds() | Computes average crack time: |pool|<sup>L</sup> / rate / 2 (half‑search assumption). | Visualizes why each extra char‑class & length bit matters exponentially.
Password Strength Tester | Calls zxcvbn(pwd) → returns guess count & sequences. | Combines corpus stats + pattern heuristics → grounded, real‑world feedback.
Log‑scale chart | Altair scatter of online vs. offline seconds. | Immediate contrast: milliseconds vs. millennia.
Reuse Blast Radius | Formula ceil(n·[1 – (1–p)^n]) | Translates “probability” into number of accounts lost—breaks optimism bias.
Credential Stuffing | Inclusion‑exclusion: breached + reused – overlap | Shows that reuse+breach overlap super‑charges attacker ROI.
Coach | strong_pw() → 128‑bit random; curated links. | Lowers activation energy from insight → action (bounded rationality fix).
